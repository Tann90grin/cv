        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <div id="intro">
            <p>Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Henry Wu, a passionate and dedicated 2A Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.</p>
            <p>I thrive in the world of technology, with a diverse skill set that encompasses software development, electrical engineering, and innovative problem-solving.</p>

            <h2>Technical Proficiency</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Proficient in C++, Python, and JAVA, I've applied my skills in various hands-on projects, mastering object-oriented programming (OOP) and showcasing competence in project design, algorithms, and data structures.</li>
                <li><strong>Engineering Expertise:</strong> With exposure to version control tools, a familiarity with the Linux operating system, and a keen understanding of processor microarchitecture and assembly language, I delve into the intricacies of technology with enthusiasm.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Engineering Enthusiast</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automation Maven:</strong> As an Electrical Engineer, I've programmed and optimized PLC programs, integrated Arduino UNO into conveyor systems, and even developed a SCADA system for real-time monitoring. My work at Martinrea International Inc. significantly improved production efficiency through automation.</li>
                <li><strong>AI and Machine Learning:</strong> My intrigue with AI and Machine Learning has led me to experiment with tools like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion, enhancing my understanding of cutting-edge technologies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Web and Software Development</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Project Collaborator:</strong> I've collaborated on projects like the Idling Monitor, where I developed a prototype device with gas sensors and microcontrollers. My involvement in the C++ Transaction History Application showcased my ability to design and implement efficient algorithms.</li>
                <li><strong>GitHub Maven:</strong> I've contributed to JAVA projects on GitHub, creating Minesweeper and School System programs. My commitment to optimizing user experience is evident in the intuitive interfaces I crafted for these projects.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Hands-On Experience</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>DIY Enthusiast:</strong> From soldering PCBs for a keyboard and a radio to assembling a personal computer, I bring a hands-on approach to my projects. These experiences have honed my attention to detail and problem diagnosis skills.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Continuous Learner</h2>
            <p>I am currently pursuing an Honours Electrical Engineering degree at the University of Waterloo, building on my foundation as a President's Scholarship of Distinction recipient.</p>
